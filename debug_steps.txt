I added console.debugs and a DOM run-debug-indicator in frontend/src/editor.jsx to help track run clicks and SSE creation.

Steps for you to follow in the browser (concise):

1) Open DevTools -> Console and Network (Preserve log enabled).
2) Reload the app so the updated frontend JS is loaded.
3) Click Run in the Sidebar.
4) Observe Console for messages prefixed by runWorkflow/openRunEventSource and for the DOM red indicator in the top-right.
   - Expected console logs:
     - "runWorkflow: invoked"
     - "runWorkflow: save result" (if it saved)
     - "runWorkflow: run queued" with runId
     - "runWorkflow: opening EventSource for run"
     - "openRunEventSource: start"
     - "openRunEventSource: using polyfill" or "using native EventSource"
     - "openRunEventSource: created es"
     - "SSE connection opened"
     - "SSE log event"/"SSE node event"/"SSE status event"

5) Verify Network tab for a GET /api/runs/<id>/stream request. If not present, the client never initiated the stream.

What to paste back here:
- Whether you see the DOM run-debug-indicator and its text.
- Exact console lines that appear when you click Run.
- Whether Network tab shows a request to /api/runs/<id>/stream.
- Any console errors (CORS, EventSource, fetch failures).

If you prefer I can push another small patch that forces the EventSource to use a fallback polling mode (fetch polling) so UI updates even if SSE is blocked. But first let's confirm what logs and network entries you see.
