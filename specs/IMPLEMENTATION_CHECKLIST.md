Implementation Checklist â€” n8n parity project

Overview

This file is a single-source checklist to track implemented work and remaining tasks required to reach feature parity with n8n. Use it to assign, mark progress, and to run DoD verification for each feature.

Guidelines
- Tasks checked [x] are implemented (committed or verified in repo).
- Tasks unchecked [ ] are outstanding.
- Each feature includes: Purpose, Acceptance criteria (DoD), Estimate, and a granular checklist.

Project status summary
- Repo scaffold with FastAPI backend, Celery/Redis worker, React frontend (react-flow) â€” [x]
- Adapter skeletons & basic worker â€” [x]
- Frontend editor MVP exists (editor runtime unstable; add-node failing historically) â€” [x]
- Spec updated toward n8n parity â€” [x]

Legend
- P0: Highest priority (editor + core runtime features)
- P1: Important but after P0
- P2: Longer-term / operational

-----------------------------
P0 (Must have)
-----------------------------

Feature: Editor stabilization & Add Node
Purpose: Make the visual editor reliable and enable node additions, rendering, save/load.
Estimate: 0.5â€“1 day
Acceptance criteria:
- Clicking Add Node invokes handler and logs event.
- New node appears on canvas (nodes[] updated).
- No runtime console errors after adding nodes.
- Editor persists saved workflows via POST /api/workflows and loads them back.

Checklist:
- [x] Audit current editor wiring and locate add-node handler (frontend)
- [x] Migrate react-flow usage to controlled pattern (onNodesChange/onEdgesChange)
- [x] Implement addNode(type) handler that creates node and updates state
- [x] Add safe fallback node renderer for unknown node types
- [x] Wire save (POST /api/workflows) and load (GET /api/workflows/:id) to editor
- [x] Add unit tests for addNode handler
- [ ] Manual test checklist and update README_SPEC

Notes: This is the immediate highest-priority task. Developer memory recommends starting here.

Estimate: 1 day
Acceptance criteria:

Feature: HTTP Request node execution
Purpose: Provide a general HTTP request node with templating and secret-based auth; mask secrets in logs and enforce outgoing connection safety.

Sprint 1 (1â€“2 days): Editor Add Node + save/load
Sprint 2 (2â€“3 days): Secrets UI + basic HTTP node wiring
Sprint 3 (2â€“3 days): Webhooks + run persistence
Sprint 4 (2â€“3 days): Run history UI + Function node + Scheduler
Sprint 5 (2â€“3 days): LLM Mock + retries + metrics
Sprint 6 (3â€“4 days): Versioning, plugins MVP, RBAC
Sprint 7 (2â€“3 days): Hardening, docs, tests, polish

-----------------------------
How to use this file
-----------------------------
- Mark tasks as complete as you merge code and verify acceptance criteria.
- Use each checklist block to create tickets in your tracker (Jira/Trello/GitHub issues).
- Keep README_SPEC.md and this file in sync; update when APIs or DB schemas change.

Completed next steps (automated updates):

- [x] (1) Implement GET /api/runs/{run_id}/logs and return a LogsResponse envelope (backend/app.py endpoint implemented and wired to schemas). Verified by backend tests.
- [x] (2) Harden worker redaction and add unit tests to ensure secrets are not persisted in RunLog entries (backend/tasks.py uses redact_secrets for structured messages; test added: backend/tests/test_write_log_redacts_dict_message.py).
- [ ] (3) Scaffold/update frontend editor files and wire them to POST/GET /api/workflows — pending further UI iterations.

Preferred default: proceed with small, focused commits for each remaining subtask so you can review changes incrementally. If you'd like a different order or want to postpone any item, tell me which.
